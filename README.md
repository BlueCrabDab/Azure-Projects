# Welcome to my Azure Project Repo

This repo will contain Azure projects, scripts and templates that I work on and think others will find useful. 


Please feel free to reach out to me with any questions or comments about any of the content found here. 

## Bio

I am a Cloud Solution Architect at Microsoft who has worked in the field for about 22 years. The last 6 years have been focused on Azure. I have a background in Security, Identity, Networking and Application Architecture so you will find most projects I place here have something to do with those areas (but not limited to those).

Thanks,
Joe
